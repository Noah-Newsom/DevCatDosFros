				What Inspired Us
	
	We made this website in the thought of letting the world know that coding can be fun and creative. It was made to inspire students in our school or even students outside of our school to learn about coding. To tell them about a whole new world and language you can learn and use it to create things. This is just a way to let people know that anyone can make a website if they put the effort into it.


			    	Our Website Info

	We fisrt started with what we would like to put in the website and make it not to simple minded. We wanted it to be creative and insporational to those who see it. We wanted something that would catch peoples attention and want to learn how to code. We used what we learned from Treehouse to make are website. We used the three common computer languages which are 
**HTML**
**CSS**
**Java Script**
those are the languages that we used for are website. In the HTML we started with the header which we learned to do first and to put the <meta charset="UTF-8">. Then we put the link to the stylesheets to add some style to are website and not just have plaine text. Then came are body for are website we then placed the div and a class with everyone of them to slect each one if needed to in the CSS. Then came are are (<ul>) which means are unordered list which is are navigation bar in are website. We added six (<li>) list items which are the six other pages in are website. We put the Homae Page, Class Time, Laser Project, First Project, Second Project, and Website Creaters. We made these pages about thingfs we work on in class most of the time and what we do. Then we add slide show in are website with pictures of are class working on Treehouse,projects, and laser projects. In the slideshow we had help on making it and we mostly used are resources to get the slideshow and then adjust the code to use it the way we wanted it to so it will work with are website. Underneath are slideshow is boxes with small icons of Class Time, Laser Projects, Website Projects, HTML, Css, and Java Script with briefe discriptions and buttons that are linked to resources so people can read more about them if they want to learn more or are interested. We got are icons for the boxes from www.flaticon.com and we set all the copyrights at the bottom on are footer to give them credit for the resources in are website.

				Are Css

	In are css we decided the bacakground would be plain white (#FFF) and the header and the footer are both maroon (#860038). We chose these color because it represents are school color and since the website is about our class in are school it went well with the website. The font we used are (Alfa Slab One), and  (Rubik). We mostly used (Alfa Slab One) in are headers and the nav to make it pop out more then the other texts. We used (Rubik) on the other texts that were not the header and the nav in the website.

				A Little Bit Of Java Script

	Java was only used in the nav, and the gallery.
